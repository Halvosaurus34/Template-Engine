## Description

We were asked to create a command line application which will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user. The main focus of buiding this code was to utilize object oriented programming. Jest was used to conduct testing on the javascript files, fs and path were used for creating/reading files.

## Issues

The main challenges were getting used to using OOP and getting everything to work together in an efficient way. Jest was also a setback when trying to pass all provided tests. Jest really helped me understand this code at a deeper level when troubleshooting failed tests.

## Collaborators
